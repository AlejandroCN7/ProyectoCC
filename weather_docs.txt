CLASSES
    builtins.object
        Prediction
    
    class Prediction(builtins.object)
     |  Common base class for prediction taken from AEMET API
     |  
     |  Attributes:
     |      city (str):           refers to the city when the prediction is taken
     |      temperature (float):  refers to the temperature in the city we refered above
     |      date (str):           actual date, when the predition is load to the database
     |      ID (int):             identificator of the object prediction
     |  
     |  By default, initially the ID is 0, and, when a object from the class is
     |  created, its ID value takes the next one avaiable.
     |  
     |  Methods defined here:
     |  
     |  __getitem__(self, key)
     |      Method to get the value of an attribute of the class. For this
     |      functionality, it works in the same way than  a dict object.
     |      
     |          Args:
     |          key (str): refers to the name of the attribute we want to know
     |          the value
     |      
     |          Returns:
     |          Value associated to the attribute called 'key'
     |  
     |  __init__(self, city, temperature)
     |      Args:
     |      city (str): refers to the city where the predition is taken.
     |      temperature (float): value of temperature for the city above.
     |  
     |  __len__(self)
     |      Method to get the value of the number of attribute in the class.
     |      
     |      Args:
     |      No args
     |      
     |      Returns:
     |      An int value that represents the number of attributes in the class
     |  
     |  __repr__(self)
     |      Method to get a string representation with the information in class.
     |      
     |      Args:
     |      No args
     |      
     |      Returns:
     |      A str with all the content of the attributes and their values.
     |  
     |  set_city(self, value)
     |      Method that allows to modify the value of the city
     |      
     |      Args:
     |      value (str): refers to the new value that the attribute city is
     |      going to take
     |      
     |      Returns:
     |      None
     |  
     |  set_temperature(self, value)
     |      Method that allows to modify the value of the temperature
     |      
     |      Args:
     |      value (str): refers to the new value that the attribute temperature
     |      is going to take
     |      
     |      Returns:
     |      None
